## 2026-02-21T21:20:14Z - PB-024 complete (agent3)
- issue: #46 (`PB-024`)
- status: implemented and validated on branch `agent3/pb-024-post-onboarding-shell`
- delivered:
  - protected post-onboarding shell for `/projects/[projectId]` routes
  - exact 5-button navbar: `Dashboard`, `Documents`, `Board`, `Timeline`, `Settings`
  - role badge + sign-out control in shared nav shell
  - desktop top-nav + mobile bottom-nav support
  - unauthenticated redirect to `/sign-in`
  - local sign-in scaffold with role/user/project selection
  - placeholder route pages wired for Dashboard/Documents/Board/Timeline/Settings + workspace route
- verification:
  - `npm run format:check` -> fails on pre-existing repo files outside task scope
  - `npx prettier --check` on touched files -> pass
  - `npm run lint` -> pass
  - `npm run build` -> pass
- blockers/notes:
  - upstream auth foundation issues (`PB-017`, `PB-018`) remain open; current auth is explicit local scaffold
  - upstream dashboard/documents/settings/workflow APIs are not yet available; follow-up tasks use scaffold + error states
