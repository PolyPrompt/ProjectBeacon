## 2026-02-21T21:08:31Z - PB-021 Milestone (Agent2)
- Issue: `#43` `[PB-021] Dashboard Summary + My Tasks APIs (Soft Deadline Sorted)` (claimed, in progress to done path).
- Completed:
  - Added `GET /api/projects/:projectId/dashboard`.
  - Added `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks/my`.
  - Implemented dashboard read-model logic for:
    - my-task sorting by soft deadline (`due_at` asc, nulls last),
    - next milestone countdown (earliest non-`done` task with non-null `due_at`),
    - final deadline countdown,
    - team status aggregation (`todo/in_progress/blocked/done`).
  - Added auth+membership guard utilities with stable API error format and role normalization (`owner/admin -> admin`, else `user`).
  - Updated `API_CONTRACT.md` with new endpoint response shapes.
- Verification:
  - `npm run format:check` => fail due pre-existing repository-wide formatting drift in docs/task files and `HANDOFF.md` (non-PB-021 scope).
  - `npm run lint` => pass.
  - `npm run build` => pass.
- Files changed:
  - `app/api/projects/[projectId]/dashboard/route.ts`
